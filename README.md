# AVR-Programs
Applied to ATmega328P,ATmega2560 and other AVR Series Micro Chip Controllers.  
Each directory contains C codes and relative C libraries for the project.  
There are two types of Codes, the First one for Arduino IDE and the Second one for Microchip Studio. Arduino IDE Programs will be marked as "A000x" and Microchip Studio Programs will be marked as "M000x".  
## How to Use?
### Codes for Arduino IDE
1.Download or copy the codes and create project in Arduino IDE software.  
2.Choosing the appropriate chip and build the project.  
3.Download essential libraries in the IDE.  
4.Test the function of the codes on develop kit or simulation software.  
### Codes for Microchip Studio
1.Download or copy the codes and create project in Microchip Studio software with appropriate chip.  
2.Build the project and load the .Hex file.  
3.Test the function of the codes on develop kit or simulation software.
